    "Abstract": "The paper describes the creation of an Arabic-Hebrew parallel corpus from TED talks, aligned using English as a pivot. The benchmark contains around 225,000 sentences and 3.5 million tokens in each language. It was prepared to assist machine translation tasks for Arabic-Hebrew and has been partitioned into train, development, and test sets similar to the IWSLT 2016 evaluation campaign.",
