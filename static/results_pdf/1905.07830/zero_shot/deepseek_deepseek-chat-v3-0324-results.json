        "Abstract": "HellaSwag is a new dataset for commonsense natural language inference, designed to be challenging for state-of-the-art models while being easy for humans. The dataset is constructed using Adversarial Filtering, a data-collection paradigm in which a series of discriminators is used to select a challenging set of generated wrong answers. The resulting dataset of 70k problems is easy for humans (95.6% accuracy), yet challenging for machines (<50%). This result holds even when models are given a significant number of training examples, and even when the test data comes from the exact same distribution as the training data. Machine performance slips an additional 5% when evaluated on examples that cover novel concepts from the same domain."
