    "Abstract": "We present FQuAD, a French Question Answering dataset composed of 10,000 question-answer pairs extracted from news articles. The dataset is designed to be used for training and evaluating question answering models in French. We provide a detailed analysis of the dataset, including its size, distribution of question types, and difficulty. We also evaluate the performance of several state-of-the-art question answering models on FQuAD. Our results show that FQuAD is a challenging dataset that can be used to benchmark the performance of question answering models in French.",
